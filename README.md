# LLM Matrix Visualization

An interactive visualization showing what Large Language Models (LLMs) actually do - pure matrix arithmetic, no neurons or brain analogies.

## Live Demo
Visit: https://cynthialmcginnis.github.io/llm-matrix-visualization/

## About
This visualization is part of a book project explaining LLMs from a mathematician's perspective for lay audiences. It demonstrates that LLMs are just:
- Matrix lookups
- Matrix multiplication
- Simple activation functions
- Repeated 96+ times

No "neural networks" in the biological sense - just linear algebra at scale.

## Usage
1. Enter any word
2. Watch step-by-step as it flows through the mathematical operations
3. See the predicted next word based on learned weights

## For Educators
Feel free to use this in teaching! The goal is to demystify AI and show the mathematical reality.
